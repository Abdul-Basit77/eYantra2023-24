Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2C. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.

1. First of all we extracted the event images from the arena.
2. To do so we used matplotlib library to plot the images and the find the approximate coordinate of each of the event.
3. using opencv and the event starting coordinate we extracted the image cropped region from the arena.
4. Now our main task is to predict the event image.
5. We imported our pretrained model trained in task2B in the task_2c.py
6. We predicted the event image using our model that was made using mobilenet and hence we resized our image to 224,224.
7. We returned the extracted event name in the desired output.
