Line Following And Geotracking

The aim of this task is to execute line following on the arena utilizing the robot constructed 
in Task 3C and geotracking its position in QGIS.


Problem Statement
In this task, the team has to make the robot traverse a specific path as shown in Figure 3. This 
is the configuration for Task 4B.
The designated starting point is the "Start Position" indicated in the arena. The timer will commence as 
soon as the robot departs from the Start Position. The robot has to traverse the entire path outlined by the nodes 
Start Point --> A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> G --> H --> I --> A --> End Point and return to the endpoint, 
which is same as the startpoint. The start of run and timer should also be indicated with a 1 second buzzer 
beep along with switching "ON" the LED.
Upon reaching each node, the robot is has to stop and activate the buzzer for a duration of 1 second to signal 
that the robot has reached a specific node. When the robot reaches the endpoint after covering all the nodes, 
it should stop and activate the Red LED and buzzer attached to the robot for 5 seconds.
Illuminating the LED and making the buzzer beep will be considered as the completion of the task, prompting 
the timer to be stopped.
