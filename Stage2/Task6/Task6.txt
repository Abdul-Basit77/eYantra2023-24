Problem Statement
In this task, the team has to make the robot traverse a suitable path on the arena and enable 
real-time geo-tracking on QGIS while taking the event distribution on the arena and priority order into account.

Five random events are placed on the arena at 5 positions. Using the overhead camera, the base station 
has to identify the events and conveys the information to the Vanguard robot. The robot, with the help 
of its path planning algorithms prepares a path to traverse the arena while following the correct priority 
as per the rulebook.
