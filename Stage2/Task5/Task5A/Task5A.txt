Mini Theme Implementation - Part 1

The aim of this task is to combine and perform all previously performed tasks to implement a 
shorter theme run. The deadline for Task for Task 5A is 23:59:59 4th February, 2024

Problem Statement
In this task, the team has to make the robot traverse a suitable path on the arena and enable 
real-time geo-tracking on QGIS while taking the event distribution on the arena and priority order into account.

Two random events are placed on the arena out of the possible 5 position. Using the overhead camera, 
the base station identifies the events and conveys the information to the Vanguard robot. The bot, with 
the help of its path planning algorithms prepares a path to traverse the arena while following the correct 
priority as per the rulebook.
