##  Theme Description:
 In this theme a combination of an overhead camera and a two wheeled robot is used to navigate an arena
 which is an actual satellite image taken from the map. As the robot navigates, its real-time position is
 continually updated on the actual map through the use of QGIS Software.

 Tasked with visiting five events positioned within the arena in a predefined priority sequence, the robot
 relies on the overhead camera setup to identify these events and their respective locations. The robot uses an
 ESP32 microcontroller along with other sensors and actuators.
